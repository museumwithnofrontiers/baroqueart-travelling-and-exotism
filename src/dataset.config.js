// pages, frame, menu and languages are its family's (`baroqueartMinisiteConfig`,
// @museumwnf/viewer-layout/minisite). What is this site's own is minisite.json
// (what legacy configured for it alone), its theme (theme/tokens.css) and its
// legacy pictures (theme/assets/legacy/, SOURCES.json names where each was
// taken from), written by inventory-app's scripts/minisites generators.

// The pictures of the frame, as Vite builds and fingerprints them; the pages
// name a file by its path under theme/assets/.
